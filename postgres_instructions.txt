---need to install virtualenv so we can define the version of python we are using in our project and let flask know what to use
$ sudo -H pip install virtualenv

---this next command will setup the virtualenv in our project (run these commands from the project folder on initial setup)
$ virtualenv env

---this command will activate the virtualenv for our project
$ . env/bin/activate

---now we can get flask activated in our virtualenv, as well as sqlalchemy, psycopg2, and flask_migrate
$ pip install flask psycopg2 sqlalchemy Flask-Migrate


---when you are ready to leave the env for our project, just type the following
$ deactivate


---below is a link for deployment options
