## Description

Haikuna-Matata generates completely original, correctly formatted haikus based on user input. A user types an input word into the console when running the program, and the program will return a 5/7/5 style haiku concerning whatever input the user put in.


## Installation & Usage

To use this program, simply clone the repository to your computer and navigate to its directory. Run the runner script, followed by the word you want to base the haiku around, and the program will output its result to the terminal.

Example:
