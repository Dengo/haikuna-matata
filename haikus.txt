sudden hail--
the argument breaks off
mid-sentence

sudden hail--
she tells me to be careful
what I wish for

distant thunder--
I dream I've forgotten
where my parents live

first frost--
the squirrel plants acorns
where we buried the cat

the scent
not the flower
is driving me crazy

first dew touch-
shlyly, the lily unfolds
her petals

still wandering...
over fields of chysanthemum
my old dream of love

the eagle s wing
understands well-
the language of wind

that full moon-
a coin falls into
the beggar's palm

strutting-
behind his shadow
a rooster

fluttering
in the spider's web
may fly

waiting for the moon
to defeat that cloud
the lonely tree

in the wilderness
I found out:
love is green

sparrows go
behind the hill singing of
lost identitiy

I m hungry for you-
the sea whispered to the
subtle fish

a stone frog
in the public garden -
wondering who I am...!

in thr river,
the moon and the star-
hugging

misty windows-
lingering on the lips
the taste of pink

after a
long night...
the morning glory

lying as a cradle
watching christmas stars-
cresent moon

Over the wintry forest,
winds howl in rage
with no leaves to blow.

An old silent pond
A frog jumps into the pond, splash!
Silence again.

Whitecaps on the bay;
A broken signboard banging
In the April wind.

pilgrim counts
every second step
stone in shoe

sugar for the tea
behind the bowl
a line of ants

fire ant mound
against the flower pot
after the rain

this spring's fragrance
were it a woman I'd
follow wherever

another test
another doctor visit
long winter nights

the colour of wind
through pine trees
must be blue

incense lit
the scent of sage
lingers in a crowd

Autumn moonlight—
a worm digs silently
into the chestnut.

Lightning flash—
what I thought were faces
are plumes of pampas grass.

I hear crackling
Crunch, of today’s new found day
And know it won’t last

Falling to the ground,
I watch a leaf settle down
In a bed of brown.

A cricket disturbed
the sleeping child; on the porch
a man smoked and smiled.

I'm turning over
look out and give me room there
you cricket, you.

In the cicada's cry
No sign can tell
How soon it must die.

First day of Spring-
I keep thinking about-
the end of autmn.

Wake, butterfly
it's late-
we've miles to go together.

Moonless night...
a powerful wind embraces
the ancient cedars.

Don't imitate me;
it's as boring
as the two halves of a melon.

The moon so pure
a wandering monk carries it
across the sand.

Night; and once again,
the while I wait for you, cold wind
turns into rain.

I want to sleep
Swat the flies
Softly, please.

When I turned my head
That traveller I'd just passed...
Melted in the mist.

My life -
How much more of it remains?
The night is brief.

My grumbling wife -
if only she were here!
this moon tonight...

A lovely thing to see:
through the paper window's hole,
the Galaxy.

The first firefly...
But he got away and I...
Air in my fingers.

In this world
we walk on the roof of hell,
gazing at flowers.

After killing
a spider, how lonely I feel
in the cold of night!

No sky
no earth - but still
snowflakes fall.

An autumn eve;
There is joy too,
In loneliness.

My arm for a pillow,
I really like myself
under the hazy moon.

The end of spring-
the poet is brooding
about editors.

The lamp once out
Cool stars enter
The window frame.

Experimenting...
I hung the moon on various
branches of the pine

First autumn morning
the mirror I stare into
shows my father's face.

moon in the cold -
only my own footsteps
on the bridge.

A firefly flitted by:
"Look!" I almost said
but I was alone.

Dead my old fine hopes
And dry my dreaming but still...
Iris, blue each spring.

A giant firefly:
That way, this way, that way, this -
and it passes by.

Following the train,
The long black smoke is crawling
Over the withered plain.

In pale moonlight
the wisteria's scent
comes from far away.

Snow whispering down
All day long earth has vanished
Leaving only sky.

In all this cool
is the moon also sleeping?
There, in the pool?

The winds that blow-
ask them, which leaf on the tree
will be next to go.

How I long to see
among dawn flowers,
the face of God.

Don't weep, insects -
Lovers, stars themselves,
Must part.

Icicles and water
Old differences dissolved...
Drip down together

I kill an ant
and realize my three children
have been watching.

Starting to call you
Come watch these butterflies . . .
Oh! I'm all alone

A harsh-rasping saw...
music of cold-poverty
in the winter midnight

Dead my old fine hopes
And dry my dreaming but still...
Iris, blue each spring

A gold bug -
I hurl into the darkness
and feel the depth of night

Fallen sick on a journey,
In dreams I run wildly
Over a withered moor.

Covered with the flowers,
Instantly I'd like to die
In this dream of ours!

not a fairytale -
sunlight turns
yellow leaves into gold

conductor's baton
a bumble bee
busy at work

Do not trust your eyes
There is danger in disguise
Beauty has two faces

Don't weep, insects –
Lovers, stars themselves,
Must part.

The lamp once out
Cool stars enter
The window frame.

They end their flight
one by one–
crows at dusk

In all this cool
is the moon also sleeping?
There, in the pool?

Night, and the moon!
My neighbor, playing on his flute -
out of tune!

Grasses wilt:
the braking locomotive
grinds to a halt.

While you decline to cry,
high on the mountainside
a single stalk of plumegrass wilts.

Hush, cawing birds; what rackets you make:
heaven's indignant messengers ...
you remind me of wordsmiths!

Onyx, this gem-black night.
Downcast, I await your return
like the morning sun, unrivaled in splendor.

Snow-obscured heights;
mist-shrouded slopes:
this spring evening.

An orphaned blossom
returning to its bough, somehow?
No, a solitary butterfly.

This darkening autumn:
my neighbor,
how does he continue?

Lightning
shatters the darkness―
the night heron's shriek

An ancient pond,
the frog leaps:
the silver plop and gurgle of water.

My eyes,
having observed everything,
returned to the white chrysanthemums.

Useless dreams, alas!
Over desolate fields
winds whisper as they pass.

Observe:
see how the wild violets bloom
within the forbidden fences!


A kite floats
at the same place in the sky
where yesterday it floated ...

Snow in my shoe
Abandoned
Sparrow’s nest

Just friends:
he watches my gauze dress
blowing on the line.

A little boy sings
on a terrace, eyes aglow.
Ridge spills upward.

Electric salsa
Glides across beans, rice and meat
dancing palate joy.

I used to date you
But now you just serve me food
One taco, no love.

Foil wrapped burrito
Is it wrong to love you so?
I don’t need a man.

lend me your arms,
fast as thunderbolts,
for a pillow on my journey.

A stone at its core,
this snowball’s the porcelain
knob on winter’s door.

an aging willow--
its image unsteady
in the flowing stream

mud-spattered pickup-
four dogs watch
the tavern door

pickup couvert de boue -
quatre chiens observent
la porte de la taverne

spring fever
my heartbeat quickens
through the avalanche zone

spring morning-
the urge to skip
and the wisdom not to

power outage
hoarfrosted pines
shimmer in moonlight

rumble of thunder-
slicing just-picked peaches
for the pie

spring fever
my pockets full
of old grocery lists

spring rain
I read his letters
one last time

the familiar wail
of a common loon-
your empty chair

Thanksgiving evening
the call of wild ducks
out on the bay

drumming rain
a patchwork of dreams
just before waking

the trail narrows-
every shadow
a possible bear

lingering grief-
calls of southbound geese
through misty rain

lingering light
through the willows
scent of rain

obsidian night
the white sound
of rain

a steady drizzle-
all day the weight
of things unsaid

sleet ticking windows--
the chemo drip
in its last hour

evening shadows
on the walls of the Alamo
graffiti

autumn chill
faint chimes
from our oldest clock

dusty knickknacks
I try to recall
the scent of burning leaves

midsummer morning--
the boat's gentle tug
at the anchor

an old woman
with a lost look in her eyes--
chilled wind

woodsmoke and fog
along the river bank
three trails meet

searcher's call
the lost child's name-
streetlamps veiled with rain

journey's end
far off in the blue distance
dark clouds

ice moon-
a berry branch
forced into bloom

avalanche warning-
how very still
this winter night

our dusty truck-
an Amish man walks barefoot
across the village green

that long-ago kiss--
and still Orion strides
the winter sky

bitter cold--
we don't chase the lone crow
from the sparrow's food

deepening snow--
she leaves our atlas open
to her homeland

warmed-over coffee--
the gray gray sound
of winter rain

no wind tonight
across this reach of prairie
all those stars

sipping fresh cider--
both dippers
among the far stars

cool morning--
at the top of the rise
deer pass in the fog

meditation room--
books of wisdom
lean left . . . and right

turning north--
sand from both oceans
in little jars

the wind all night
rips limbs from the trees-
a long wait for dawn

winter roses
I am tired of reading
between the lines

rainy New York
from the tenth storey window
black umbrellas bloom

drunk on the beach-
the moon in my sake cup
disappears

faintly purple
against the moon -
pines in the light

the last light of day ~
purple rhododendrons
dissolve in the dark

wisteria -
blooming before
the end of rain

through lace
the tracery of frost
on glass

rain
falls from the trees
on the blue iris

winter beach -
three grey lines
of sand, sea and sky

winter -
white peonies
in falling snow
