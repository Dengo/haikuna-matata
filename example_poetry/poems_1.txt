April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.
Winter kept us warm, covering
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
A little life with dried tubers.
Summer surprised us, coming over the
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.

And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
And I was frightened. He said,
hold on tight. And down we went.
In the mountains, there you feel free.
I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
And the dry stone no sound of water. Only
There is shadow under this red rock,
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),
And I will show you something different from either
Your shadow at morning striding behind you
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;
I will show you fear in a handful of dust.

"You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;
"They called me the  girl."
—Yet when we came back, late, from the garden,
Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not
Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,
Looking into the heart of light, the silence.


Had a bad cold, nevertheless
Is known to be the wisest woman in
With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,
Is your card, the drowned Sailor,
(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)
Here is  the Lady of the Rocks,
The lady of situations.
Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,
And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,
Which is blank, is something he carries on his back,
Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find
The Hanged Man. Fear death by water.
I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.
Thank you. If you see dear
Tell her I bring the horoscope myself:
One must be so careful these days.

Unreal City,
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,
I had not thought death had undone so many.
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,
To where Saint Mary kept the hours
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying
"You who were with me in the ships at
"That corpse you planted last year in your garden,
"Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?
"Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?
"Oh keep the Dog far hence, that's friend to men,
"Or with his nails he'll dig it up again!



The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne,
Glowed on the marble, where the glass
Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines
From which a golden peeped out
(Another hid his eyes behind his wing)
Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra
Reflecting light upon the table as
The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,
From satin cases poured in rich profusion.
In vials of ivory and coloured glass
Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,
 powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused
And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air
That freshened from the window, these ascended
In fattening the prolonged candle-flames,
Flung their smoke into the
Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.
Huge sea-wood fed with copper
Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,
In which sad light a dolphin swam.
Above the antique mantel was displayed
As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene
The change of P by the barbarous king
So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale
Filled all the desert with inviolable voice
And still she cried, and still the world pursues,
"Jug Jug" to dirty ears.
And other withered stumps of time
Were told upon the walls; staring forms
Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.
Footsteps shuffled on the stair.
Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair
Spread out in fiery points
Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.

"My nerves are bad to-night. Yes, bad. Stay with me.
"Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak.
"What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?
"I never know what you are thinking. Think."

I think we are in rats' alley
Where the dead men lost their bones.

"What is that noise?"
                             The wind under the door.
"What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?"
                             Nothing again nothing.
"Do
"You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember
"Nothing?"

   I remember
Those are pearls that were his eyes.
"Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?"
But
O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag—
It's so elegant
So intelligent
"What shall I do now? What shall I do?"
I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street
"With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow?
"What shall we ever do?"
                                     The hot water at ten.
And if it rains, a closed car at four.
And we shall play a game of chess,
Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.

When Lil's husband got demobbed, I said—
I didn't mince my words, I said to her myself,
HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME
Now Albert's coming back, make yourself a bit smart.
He'll want to know what you done with that money he gave you
To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.
You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,
He said, I swear, I can't bear to look at you.
And no more can't I, I said, and think of poor Albert,
He's been in the army four years, he wants a good time,
And if you don't give it him, there's others will, I said.
Oh is there, she said. Something o' that, I said.
Then I'll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.
HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME
If you don't like it you can get on with it, I said.
Others can pick and choose if you can't.
But if Albert makes off, it won't be for lack of telling.
You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.
(And her only thirty-one.)
I can't help it, she said, pulling a long face,
It's them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.
(She's had five already, and nearly died of young George.)
The chemist said it would be all right, but I've never been the same.
You are a proper fool, I said.
Well, if Albert won't leave you alone, there it is, I said,
What you get married for if you don't want children?
HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME
Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,
And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—
HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME
HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME
Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight.
Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight.
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.

The river's tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf
Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind
Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.
The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,
Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends
Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.
And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors;
Departed, have left no addresses.
By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . .
Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,
Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.
But at my back in a cold blast I hear
The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.
A rat crept softly through the vegetation
Dragging its slimy belly on the bank
While I was fishing in the dull canal
On a winter evening round behind the gashouse
Musing upon the king my brother's wreck
And on the king my father's death before him.
White bodies naked on the low damp ground
And bones cast in a little low dry garret,
Rattled by the rat's foot only, year to year.
But at my back from time to time I hear
The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring
Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.
O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter
And on her daughter
They wash their feet in soda water
Et O ces voix d'enfants, chantant dans la coupole!

Twit twit twit
Jug jug jug jug jug jug
So rudely forc'd.

Unreal City
Under the brown fog of a winter noon
Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant
Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants
C.i.f. London: documents at sight,
Asked me in demotic French
To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel
Followed by a weekend at the Metropole.

At the violet hour, when the eyes and back
Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits
Like a taxi throbbing waiting,
I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,
Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see
At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives
Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,
The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights
Her stove, and lays out food in tins.
Out of the window perilously spread
Her drying combinations touched by the sun's last rays,
On the divan are piled (at night her bed)
Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.
I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs
Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest—
I too awaited the expected guest.
He, the young man carbuncular, arrives,
A small house agent's clerk, with one bold stare,
One of the low on whom assurance sits
As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.
The time is now propitious, as he guesses,
The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,
Endeavours to engage her in caresses
Which still are unreproved, if undesired.
Flushed and decided, he assaults at once;
Exploring hands encounter no defence;
His vanity requires no response,
And makes a welcome of indifference.
(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all
Enacted on this same divan or bed;
I who have sat by Thebes below the wall
And walked among the lowest of the dead.)
Bestows one final patronising kiss,
And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . .

She turns and looks a moment in the glass,
Hardly aware of her departed lover;
Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:
"Well now that's done: and I'm glad it's over."
When lovely woman stoops to folly and
Paces about her room again, alone,
She smooths her hair with automatic hand,
And puts a record on the gramophone.

"This music crept by me upon the waters"
And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.
O City city, I can sometimes hear
Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,
The pleasant whining of a mandoline
And a clatter and a chatter from within
Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls
Of Magnus Martyr hold
Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.

The river sweats
Oil and tar
The barges drift
With the turning tide
Red sails
Wide
To leeward, swing on the heavy spar.
The barges wash
Drifting logs
Down Greenwich reach
Past the Isle of Dogs.
    Weialala leia
    Wallala leialala
Elizabeth and Leicester
Beating oars
The stern was formed
A gilded shell
Red and gold
The brisk swell
Rippled both shores
Southwest wind
Carried down stream
The peal of bells
White towers
    Weialala leia
    Wallala leialala

"Trams and dusty trees.
Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew
Undid me. By Richmond I raised my knees
Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe."

"My feet are at Moorgate, and my heart
Under my feet. After the event
He wept. He promised 'a new start'.
I made no comment. What should I resent?"
"On Margate Sands.
I can connect
Nothing with nothing.
The broken fingernails of dirty hands.
My people humble people who expect
Nothing."
     la la

To Carthage then I came

Burning burning burning burning
O Lord Thou pluckest me out
O Lord Thou pluckest me out

Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,
Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell
And the profit and loss.
                                         A current under sea
Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell
He passed the stages of his age and youth
Entering the whirlpool.
                                       Gentile or Jew
O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,
Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.

After the torchlight red on sweaty faces
After the frosty silence in the gardens
After the agony in stony places
The shouting and the crying
Prison and palace and reverberation
Of thunder of spring over distant mountains
He who was living is now dead
We who were living are now dying
With a little patience

Here is no water but only rock
Rock and no water and the sandy road
The road winding above among the mountains
Which are mountains of rock without water
If there were water we should stop and drink
Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think
Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand
If there were only water amongst the rock
Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit
Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit
There is not even silence in the mountains
But dry sterile thunder without rain
There is not even solitude in the mountains
But red sullen faces sneer and snarl
From doors of mudcracked houses
If there were water
And no rock
If there were rock
And also water
And water
A spring
A pool among the rock
If there were the sound of water only
Not the cicada
And dry grass singing
But sound of water over a rock
Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees
Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop
But there is no water

Who is the third who walks always beside you?
When I count, there are only you and I together
But when I look ahead up the white road
There is always another one walking beside you
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded
I do not know whether a man or a woman
—But who is that on the other side of you?

What is that sound high in the air
Murmur of maternal lamentation
Who are those hooded hordes swarming
Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth
Ringed by the flat horizon only
What is the city over the mountains
Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air
Falling towers
Jerusalem Athens Alexandria
Vienna London
Unreal

A woman drew her long black hair out tight
And fiddled whisper music on those strings
And bats with baby faces in the violet light
Whistled, and beat their wings
And crawled head downward down a blackened wall
And upside down in air were towers
Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours
And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.

In this decayed hole among the mountains
In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing
Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel
There is the empty chapel, only the wind's home.
It has no windows, and the door swings,
Dry bones can harm no one.
Only a cock stood on the rooftree
Co co rico co co rico
In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust
Bringing rain

Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves
Waited for rain, while the black clouds
Gathered far distant, over Himavant.
The jungle crouched, humped in silence.
Then spoke the thunder
DA
Datta: what have we given?
My friend, blood shaking my heart
The awful daring of a moment's surrender
Which an age of prudence can never retract
By this, and this only, we have existed
Which is not to be found in our obituaries
Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider
Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor
In our empty rooms
DA
Dayadhvam: I have heard the key
Turn in the door once and turn once only
We think of the key, each in his prison
Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison
Only at nightfall, aetherial rumours
Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus
DA
Damyata: The boat responded
Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar
The sea was calm, your heart would have responded
Gaily, when invited, beating obedient
To controlling hands

                                     I sat upon the shore
Fishing, with the arid plain behind me
Shall I at least set my lands in order?
London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down
Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina
Quando fiam ceu chelidon— O swallow swallow
These fragments I have shored against my ruins
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo's mad againe.
Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.

Say, what is the spell, when her fledgelings are chee[ping,
     That lures the bird home to her nest?
Or wakes the tired mother, whose infant is weeping,
     To cuddle and croon it to rest?
What the magic that charms the glad babe in her arms,
     Till it cooes with the voice of the dove?
'Tis a secret, and so let us whisper it low-
     And the name of the secret is Love!
          For I think it is Love,
          For I feel it is Love,
     For I'm sure it is nothing but Love!

Say, whence is the voice that, when anger is burning,
     Bids the whirl of the tempest to cease?
That stirs the vexed soul with an aching- a yearning
     For the brotherly hand-grip of peace?
Whence the music that fills all our being- that thrills
     Around us, beneath, and above?
'Tis a secret: none knows how it comes, how it goes-
     But the name of the secret is Love!
          For I think it is Love,
For I feel it is Love,
     For I'm sure it is nothing but Love!

Say, whose is the skill that paints valley and hill,
     Like a picture so fair to the sight?
That flecks the green meadow with sunshine and shadow,
     Till the little lamb leap with delight?
'Tis a secret untold to hearts cruel and cold,
     Though 'tis sung, by the angels above,
In notes that ring clear for the ears that can hear-
     And the name of the secret is Love!
          For I think it is Love,
          For I feel it is Love,
     For I'm sure it is nothing but Love!

Broken hearts and shattered dreams
Happens to me a lot it seems
An endless cycle of despair
It seems no one really cares
Sometimes.

A closed heart, it seems to be
Is my only defense from me
When I open up some more
The world quickly slams the door
Hurting.

We've known each other for a while
Now it will hurt when I see your smile
For I thought I knew you fairly well
But now I'm trapped in my lonely hell
Dying.

You know that we will stay friends
For true friendships have no ends
I made my heart as clear as glass
Now the hurt inside me will pass
Slowly.......

I'm over the pain, but not completely
The fire smoulders and my heart beats weakly
The haze is gone, and clear are my eyes
What I felt for you is gone from our lives
Completely.

But the effects of this event
The aftershocks I can't prevent
They will never really go away
And I will always find it hard to say
Truthfully.

Because this has happened before
It's happened so many times before
And I'll never recover from anyone
It's hard to believe that I've never won
Honestly.

I've tried before and always been hurt
So many times been made to feel like dirt
I always seem to find the one who
Will always, without fail, say no
Destroying.

And now that it's over, now that it's done
I hope that someday I will find the one
That won't say no, that won't turn away
That will actually want me to say
"I love you."

'Tis a grand old tradition,
the fisherman's tale.
It's begun over coffee
and  enlarged with ale
As the brandy is passed
the meek become hale
And by midnight
The damned thing's turned into a whale.

To sit at the feet of a fishman
one must be very still
To learn the art of the angler
one must learn to kill

The silver trout may teach us
to use an artful lure
The muddy cat will show us
humility for sure

A blue gill gives us laughter
on sunlit morning stream
But the bass, o' flying swimmer
Fulfills our greatest dream

For money in the hand of man
Must soon be spent in game
Besides, fishing is safer
Our gilled friends are tame!


Time loops
Reality
Virtual insanity
Ahhhhhhh
Endless ecstacy

And spring is born a world away
against the coming winter grey

Space warps
Infinity
Cyber divinity
Oooooohh
What trinity?


Here it is, a quick silver creation
 In zeroes and ones.
Slipped beneath the eye of the sleeping
 whispered into the ear of the dead.
Wrenched from the heart of the bleeding
 screaming, abandoned, cowering in dread.

Get your red hot erotica, your tears frozen
 In zeros and ones.
Dashed against walls of blue indifference
 whimpering behind the secret screen
Presented by false names and lying faces
 writen by flying fingers never seen.

Step up, it's going fast, about to run out
 In zeros and ones.


Got a journal of insanity
 Got a trip log from hell
  Got a volume of results
   Got a lot crap to sell.

Got the coin to take a peek
 Got the nerve to take a ride
  Got the balls to face the music
   Got a real tough hide

 Got a time load of pain
  Got a trip wire on  oblivion
   Got a joke to tell myself tonight
    Gotta do it all again someday


 Got ribbons to tie it up
  Got bells to make it ring
   Got visions for the Lady
    Got orgasms for the King


 Got a lot of gall you silly bastard
  Got a big brass ring
   Got the world by the horns, baby
    Got a crazy bitch to sing

 Got eternity to make it balance
  Got a path for every foot
   Got a train named Blain to take you there
    Got that spaceship booked


 Got to go, I'm sleepy now
  Got a lot to learn
   Got no one to keep me warm
    Got no one to make me burn


 Got to figure out how the hell this stupid note to no one
   Got inside my head
    Got got got got no brain
     Got ripples in a 6-D dream pool, though.


Coming apart at the seams of myriad realities
Buried by what, in what?
The earth is alight, alive.
The air is pure, crisp, clean
Or dreaming of cleaning itself
The fire burns because it has fuel
Because it must cleanse itself
The water flows, creating it's own patterns.

Ah, then it *is* the fifth firth.
And half a world away the anger,
The defenses go up,
Reflections near and far.


Who will bleed so prettily for them when I am done?
Ah, of course, we breed like weeds, do we
The fools and the dreamers,
The reapers of ridicule
The bearers of burdens only we can feel.
Crushed beneath all of us
Drowning in the pretty, the petty
Drowning in the fluff...in time
In questions...of myriad realities.


In the places of healing
The colors you wear
The songs that you sing
The creeds that you bear

The tools you deploy
The halls where you walk
The aches you destroy
The diseases you stalk

The herbs you hand out
The waters you share
'Tis plain beyond doubt
It's the intent of your care


The cold garret of the artist...the
trance place of the mystic...  to
walk this place causes the body to
be forgotten, or to be the
all...depending upon the dream.

IT is a place, perhaps of shared
spirits, shared dreams, a chaotic
whirlpool of all that we have ever
been, all that we ever will be, each
and together.  Heaven and hell mean
nothing to the gypsy...she sees them
as one...in this place.  But she
wonders....and waits....and
sometimes she reaches out a finger,
to touch a whisp of this place.  She
retracts her finger, looks at it,
and points it at the places in
reality that match it.

No one listens, and that is as it
should be...but she smiles and cries
as she watches others touch the
essence of this place, and hopes
that they may give to or receive
from this place more than she has
ever been able to....


There are bells in the garden
 which tinkle in the night
Their elven whispers sing
 of green sleep's delight
 'neath a moon of silver splender
 overcast by winter's light.

And she dreams of spring

Their are reeds in the wind
 which whistle at the dawn
Their ruffled howls cry
 at the clouds gray drawn
 a morning's coverlet, frozen
 where the flowers have gone.

And she wishes for spring

There are drums 'neath the earth
 which echo at the gloaming
Their marching beat reflects
 on each cycle's roaming
 o'er day's silent wisdoms
 at the ebbtide, chill, foaming.

And she waits for spring.


The blood runs deep
and the blood runs cold
in the deep of time
where the tales are told

When that which is fey
comes into the light
there is mass confusion
from the double sight

She breathes in the night
and exhales the dawn
her tired anger stirs
at the death of the fawn.

She walks alone through
the cold grey mist
and her bosom burns
Where his lips have kissed

Tis best she sleep
Through the times of man
let him build his worlds
whilst he still can.


Lost in the dreamer's dream I soar
on the wings of words woven softly
in a twilight song.

There are no clouds so gentle as
the visions of a poet who dares
the beauty of love.

There are no winds to whipser
with tinkling bells so silven
as the voice of hope.

There is nere a fire so welcome
as the flickering arms of
solace offered by desire.

There is no sleep so sought after
as that sweet shadow built by
by the lover's caress.

Found in the dreamer's dream I swim
into the depths of time,
again in the morning's arms.


To loose the budding gift
To rise beyond the pain
Alight the Night!
Recall the day!
I no longer walk this Way.

Battlefields above the clouds
Blood below the fields
Children weep!
I hear them cry.
This path to glory's dry.

Invoke me not, mortal fool
My sister stands in pain
I know your touch
'A gift' you say ?
Ah, one I would repay.


They'll be coming now, on the night shift.
Whispering silences through a shadow's gift
Ain't no song sung brighter under the sun
Ain't no tears saved once they've begun.
Ain't no safe place, child, where you can run.

Well, I guess I'm morbid enough for a beer now....

Blinded by image's solar flares
carona haloes afire
at the world's horizons
Dreamer weaps tears
and this sea is borne

Adrift in salinic baths
of life's reserve
her varied enterpretations
Slumber sighs, turning
and the winds arise.

Drawn again, called
by bloods pulsing rythms
cycles at the surface awake
and Sleep's illusions
are Reality's masks.

Did you look into the face of the old black rose
 When you thought you'd rather die?
Did you see something there you didn't have
 Something that made you cry
For the strength to go on through the dullest day
 And the fight to stand proud in the light.

Did you gaze into the heart of the old black rose
 When you knew you'd seen it before
Did you feel something there that you'd lost somehow
 Something a part of your core
Ripped and torn by the winds of fate from a center
 Gone cold in the glare of pain.

Did you know yourself there in the old black rose
 But for the chance roll of the dice?
Did you find something there that you needed to love
 Something that shattered the ice
Of ignorance passed back and forth through the lines
 Of color and gender and time.

Did you leave something there with the old black rose
 Something you needed to give
Did you pass through the life of eternity's child
 Did you let her teach you to live
In a world filled with scattered lovers and friends
 And children who prey on your mind.

Then there on the lips of the old black rose
 Rides a smile you wish you could touch
And there in the eyes of woman ill used
 An old woman who gave you so much
Of yourself while you rocked on the porch and heard
 The hope of 'just one more visit'.


Oh, Death! Is that you
Who've at last come to rescue me
From this mediocre cursedness, inanity

Pray, what hast kept you
As I wallowed ever in this field
Toiling with tears years without yield

Love, what cloak wear you
Come closer that I may touch the thread
And cast away this life, this endless dread

Ah, tis light beyond compare
Here in your caring arms at rest at last
What?  What the hell do you mean 'relive the past'?

Death where have you fled
Now that I breathe afresh the morning dew
Ah, another long wait until I may touch you!

The difference between a blow dryer and a flame thrower?
You make the call.
Something to do with tactics...
A firm grasp of the obvious.
Another stunning victory for the uncunning,
The glass jaw of defeat.
In the international magazine shop, the proprietor plays
The World's Worst Ethnic Music, volume two.
His lucky tape.
My favorite genre of music: pointless noodling.
Or rather, Pointillist Mood Ring.
Yours too?  Whatta team!
Nobody promised us beauty--the stairway
To the apartment caked with paint the color of a toothache.
Nothing you would have tolerated in a fire escape
Half a lifetime ago.  Sorry sweetie.
Now your working life is half over and what've you got?
A chicken in every pot and not a pot to piss in
And the good taste not to waste your wishes on realism.
Saving grace that the internal life lasts longer than long:
Stars shall fall from the sky,
Ibuprofen bottles shall pop their childproof caps!
But not yet, maybe not even soon.
What fun would that be?  What challenge?
After work you hear:
"Anchor Steam is to me what spinach is to Popeye."
Ain't nobody's business if I say
Outside the Art Factory all the young painters
Owe themselves a living,
Lined up dressed in black, praying
      God I hope my grant comes through
      God I hope my grant comes through--
Money destined for names everybody already knows.
Next up, the firing squad,
A better bad movie,
A widget, a mouse-trap, a paradigm, a school.
A trend, if we're lucky.



DO WHAT YOU LOVE AND THE MONEY WILL FOLLOW, IF YOU VISUALIZE A RICH
RELATIVE (WHO LIKES YOU) DYING REAL SOON NOW


Let's talk data.
You're DBased. All sorted out. All out of sorts.
More debris from the Information Age
Scattershot rattletrap ricochet all the way home.
The usual "chew on this, buddy."
Very infotaining.
The word "networking" has aquired so many meanings
It now means everything.
So give it up, give in to it.
There's twelve steps out there somewhere
That address your particular problem.
As opposed to that dweeb over there,
Who imagines himself an information surfer in mid-dude-ism,
But in a parallel reality
He's just a guy with an ulcer for a job,
A flycasting wannabe
With a Sharper Image catalog for an imagination.
"Watch the undertow, buddy.
Watch the undertow. "
We didn't make this world, so we'll have to lie to it.
Is it resume time? We'll let you know.
News is not reported, it is released
Wicked as a spitball. Write a personals ad:
"Desperate seeking insanely desperate. Someone
Who will take me."
Upload it to the on-line service. She'll buy it.
Why not? She's a consumer.
Dinner, drinks, dancing, and maybe later,
Date-rape.
That's the way business is done. It's a career,
Not your life or anything. Now bend over.
With enough coke it can even seem like pleasure.
But don't forget to count them beans. Keep your receipts.
The city is just a conduit for business.
Plug and play. Plug away.
Spelunk your synapses for the next innovation:
Misfire or mismanagement. Rising stars go nova,
Then you're out on your ass. Resume time!
Jerk your fingers to the known. You've got connections.
Work them puppies!
So there it is:
The state of the art, the state of the states.
All wired up and nothing to know.
We'll get back to you.


A word from another age, an age of
What? Property? Propriety?
To us it's all Zagnut bars and Rice Krispies:
"First, you harvest the rice. Then..."
The new term for bus is "crack shuttle,"
And let's not get into the MicroChannel(tm)
Versus Extended Industry Standard Architecture bit, okay?
With computers, I'll take the chip
And let everything else fall where it may,
As if performance were speed and speed only.
Spinelli's espresso,
A dog so nervous, even his pecker jitters.
To work downtown, you not only have to do the job,
But be pretty enough for them, and wear the right clothes.
You have to talk the talk, and walk the talk,
A real no-brainer. Duh-on-a-stick.
Precision is greatly overrated:
I say close enough for jazz, close enough for government work.
Just round the tax I owe
Up to the nearest o-let's-say ten thousand.
Don't deal with decimals. That part of the brain is dead.
So let's mourn it now, the death of calculation.
Ten hours of silence, a nice round number.
We've got vending machines full of Zagnut bars for the engineers And
accountants, so nobody else needs to count out change.


In the desert, the boring desert the jarhead sleeps tonight.
Dream on, white boy. Wake me up when I'm over it.
Back here at home where he used to vote
All the good causes are lined up and down the street:
Feed the homeless dinner tonight, stop US militarism, stop
Prop pick a number, any number.
"I don't want to argue, I just want you to agree with me."
The perfect marriage of the Harvard School of Business MBA
And the U of Anyold MFA:
An economy based on weapons that don't work.
The usual revenge of the second rate.
We've gotta blow up some tanks so we can build more.
"Stick with me, kid, you'll go
Bankrupt."  The Savings and Loans have all closed down,
But the ATMs are everywhere. Now they've got your address,
Next they'll have you pissing in a jar.
The proof is in the putting
Out, putting down, putting off. It's always been put up and shut up
Or shut down the whole operation.
A shut off valve is needed, is blown.
A whole generation that grew up in video arcades,
And would rather shoot down aircraft
Than shoot off their mouths?  I can hardly believe that.
Between the neo-urbane musings of the pols
And the foul mouthings of the unleashed mentally ill,
The have-nots ask the almost-have-nots for change.
You don't want change.
You're one paycheck away yourself.
The work would be hilarious if it didn't kill you. No ideas but in
Excuses, if the good ones aren't all spoken for.
Between the quick and the dead and the quicker and the quicklime,
Hell, there must be hundreds of ways to turn a desert
Into glass.


Kathleen was quoting somebody when she said
     "You can't swing a dead cat by the tail in San Francisco
      Without hitting somebody with a nose ring"
And I meant to ask "Is that the law
Or just a statistical analysis?"
In the mail ten pounds of Voter Information
I don't want to read.
What do you expect in a state whose history starts out
Like a small Latin American country then turns
Into a cartoon?
The candidates don't matter.
Its all those propositions, home-brewed law.  Gotta study up.
BackEastDownSouth we used the familiar formula:
Vote and complain, vote and complain.
We're in reverse:
How much participation can we stand?
"The voters wanted it": the perfect excuse
When our pols run for elsewhere office and want to sound-byte
          less liberal.
Such individuals that rise to serve!
Why would we want to ignore them?

You can respect anything, but awe just happens.
I'm living proof I'll live through this
But what does that prove?
No end to view it from but now,
Or now
Or now...like outtasight, but hardly insight.
Might as well be the jerk
And heave of industrial parts
If you're actually gonna drink that yellow drool
Straight from the faucet.
We do not endure the city, we are it,
Bile, backwash, and look! what a view!
I can hardly believe that's us too--
The pyramid lit up, skinny sky-finger
Finger fucks the clouds,
Gives god and everybody the finger.
I'd second that, if there weren't already such a crowd,
But look what it is!
Brighter than stars!  And closer!
If we could only breathe this crap, it'd be paradise.


Whatcha gonna do when honeybunny goes Flake-O?
As Senator Don Riegle Jr. of Michigan
Once said in a tape-recorded conversation with an aide:
"I--I--God, I feel such super love for you.
By the way, the newsletter should start arriving."
No anti-bodies for this disease, no sir.
No wuss this.
"Healing wounds all times,
What you don't hurt won't know you..."
Just do the gig, okay Nancy?
The lesbian dressed biker-butch and I cruise the same
Women--too young for either of us--
Outside SF Coffee Co., the sun
On the coffee-stained sidewalk, face sides, school folding chairs.
Learn something why doncha?
"If I want your opinion, I'll beat it outta ya."
We laughed at that--in sickness, health.  Vice inverse-o.
O, we can buy books from the happiness industry,
We can pay cash money for counseling,
We can really spend some time on what's really wrong with us...
We can grow into it:
The perfect mate.
Or what the hell, just visualize it.  Nice try.  Instead it's:
"I feel such super love for you I could buy you
A mirror, cheaper than a coffin."
You send me my stuff, through friends, in a bag.
I send you your stuff.  Same bag, different friends.
On the sidewalk, on a folding chair custom designed
For a howling pain in the ass,
She sips coffee, squirms in her leathers,
Reads another page of another book on
The One True Goddess.
Burps loud.  Says "'Scuse ME."

All year, death, after death, after death.
Then today look how majestically clouds float in the sky,
God putting on a show of tenderness, nothing like thoughts
that rise and drift in my mind, like flakes shaken
in a snow globe, and my brain laboring in its own night,
never feeling the punky starlight of dark thirty, the time
a friend said for us to meet and had to explain it was half an hour
after the first dark, when daylilies fold up and headlights
lead the way home, but maybe too early
to find the moon turning half its body away,
holding it hidden like the black side of a mirror, unseen
until it breaks, unexpectedly, the way grief
breaks over you when you've already given all you've got
and hands you tools you don't know how to use.

The blush of dark thirty turned bleak
when I heard about the O—
O dark thirty, military time for 12:30 a.m.,
hour of the deepest dark, when, if I'm awake,
as I often am, a storm of thoughts battle one another, now settling
unsettlingly on the ways we make war and flaunt it.
Take the Civil War double cannon the lawn
of a city hall in the deep south, twinned so that two cannonballs
chained together kill two at a time, often decapitating.
And why did a small town, population 932, in rural New Hampshire,
import a ballistic missile to crown its village green?

Brecht's line floats up: "Pity the nation that needs heroes,"
but what to do with the guy pontificating on the Middle East,
telling me with the gravest authority—
that of stupidity—the reason for the strife there:
"Hatred is in the rocks."

Has anyone desribed the smell of wishbones drying
on the kitchen sill or the smell of glass, or the bucket of water
lifted from the well we go to when death takes the last thirst
from someone we love?

After my mother died, sometimes
I'd take the one piece of her clothing I'd kept
to bed and bury my face
in her flowered blouse to smell her last skin,
but even from the first it was futile.

What I got was the smell of goneness, the smell of screen
doors where moths have spent their wing powder
beating failingly to reach the light.

My massage therapist said she felt grief
in my body like hard empty boxes.
I felt like I was always handling dough,
never wanting the kneading to be done, never wanting
to bake the bread that meant the end of something having to do
with a mother and daughter in a kitchen.

My mother has been gone for years, and I begin to see,
in the spots on the backs of my hands, in the shelf
my cheekbones make for my cheeks, in the way I hold
my mouth against gravity's pull, that I carry her
wiht me, my skin, her skin,
her last skin.

The few strings snap and pull
the doll’s flimsy limbs for his last
ballet, an American piece, arms flung
like a flamingo’s wings, his sashay
a flame’s undulation, dip, wave, head
snapped into a skygaze, a pained grin white
beneath the doorway’s light, legs braiding
in the climactic pirouette, convulsive
shoulders rolling, the body’s final drift
smooth as a sun-baked bloodflake
flecked off a rhino’s horn, the gored
corpse sweet meat to a smoky gauze
of ravenous flies humming and blood-
sucking tiny gunpowder-singed hearts,
charred kiss marks, until, at last,
the strings go slack, the doll
sprawls in a crippled collapse, his face
half lit, the puppeteers praising this black
ghost’s steel-pierced, last dying
quake, the dead sweet and clean,
and that last wheeze, an escaping, you’ve heard
it, drops the floodgates for the real ghosts,
a bouqet of them, a blitzkrieg of black orchids
roaring. And they blaze.

It’s the shivering. When rage grows
hot as an army of red ants and forces
the mind to quiet the body, the quakes
emerge, sometimes just the knees,
but, at worst, through the hips, chest, neck
until, like a virus, slipping inside the lungs
and pulse, every ounce of strength tapped
to squeeze words from my taut lips,
his eyes scanning my car’s insides, my eyes,
my license, and as I answer the questions
3, 4, 5 times, my jaw tight as a vice,
his hand massaging the gun butt, I
imagine things I don’t want to
and inside beg this to end
before the shiver catches my
hands, and he sees,
and something happens.

If you find yourself half naked
and barefoot in the frosty grass, hearing,
again, the earth's great, sonorous moan that says
you are the air of the now and gone, that says
all you love will turn to dust,
and will meet you there, do not
raise your first. Do not raise
your small voice against it. And do not
take cover. Instead, curl your toes
into the grass, watch the cloud
ascending from your lips. Walk
through the garden's dormant splendor.
Say only, thank you.
Thank you.

Because he was 38, because this
was his second job, because
he had two daughters, because his hands
looked like my father's, because at 7
he would walk to the furniture warehouse,
unload trucks 'til 3 AM, because I
was fourteen and training him, because he made
$3.75 an hour, because he had a wife
to look in the face, because
he acted like he respected me,
because he was sick and would not call out
I didn't blink when the water
dropped from his nose
into the onion's perfectly circular
mouth on the Whopper Jr.
I coached him through preparing.
I did not blink.
Tell me this didn't happen.
I dare you.

Isn't it always the heart that wants to wash
the elephant, begging the body to do it
with soap and water, a ladder, hands,
in tree-shade big enough for the vast savannahs
of your sadness, the strangler fig of your guilt,
the cratered full moon's light fueling
the windy spooling memory of elephant?

What if Father Quinn had said, "Of course you'll recognize
your parents in heaven," instead of
"Being one with God will make your mother and father
pointless." That was back when I was young enough
to love them absolutely though still fear for their place
in heaven, imagining their souls like sponges full
of something resembling street water after rain.

Still my mother sent me every Saturday to confess,
to wring the sins out of my small baffled soul, and I made up lies
about lying, disobeying, chewing gum in church, to offer them
as carefully as I handed over the knotted handkercheif of coins
to the grocer when my mother sent me for a loaf of Wonder,
Land O'Lakes, and two Camels.

If guilt is the damage of childhood, then eros is the fall of adolescence.
Of the fall begins there, and never ends, desire after desire parading
through a lifetime like the Ringling Brothers elephants
made to walk through the Queens-Midtown Tuunnel
and down 34th Street to the Garden.
So much of our desire like their bulky, shadowy walking
after midnight, exiled from the wild and destined
for a circus with its tawdry gaudiness, its unspoken
pathos.

It takes more than half a century to figure out who they were,
the few real loves-of-your-life and how much of the rest—
the mad breaking-heart stickiness—falls away, slowly,
unnoticed, the way you lose your taste for things
like Popsicles unthinkingly.
And though dailiness may have no place
for the ones that have etched themselves in the laugh lines
and frown lines on the face that's harder and harder
to claim as your own, often one love-of-your-life
will appear in a dream, arriving
with the weight and certitude of an elephant,
and it's always the heart that wants to go out and wash
the huge mysteriousness of what they meant, those memories
that have only memories to feed them, and only you to keep them clean.

My departure from the city of O.?
I took no leave.

I’d learned to sleep angry.

On a train I was contained.

The water under the bridge
was just that. Shunned metaphor.

It did not send waves of regret
or make me reflect.
It did not baptize, wash away, or cleanse.

The countryside appeared
like the sides of any country
where rain falls and cows chew yellow flowers.

The world was not too much
or too much with me.

I stomached it.

In the photograph I only look lonely
because I was alone.

You cannot see the envelope on my lap
or the letters lodged under sweaters in my suitcase.

I carried only one bag, what I could manage
in a crowd.

You can imagine I held a thick book
from which nothing could distract me.
You can imagine my head high, eyes dry.

I did not see my departure as a failure, or a fall.
I’d dodged a bullet. Been reborn.

You can imagine it that way.

Only none of it was like that,
not like that at all.

We come here
These little pillars of salt
Placed into the hands
Of physicians
With debt sweats
A gross product
Of the sex apparatus
There are expired teens
There are the old
That die in the summer
The situation
When a nation
Loses its beloved celebrity
It tries to out-mourn one another
Extort them of their talent
Versions of these chosen ones
Hair flowing free and unrestricted
Meanwhile
The curbs are laced
With water soluble prescriptions
Running down into gutters
Phosphorescent in the streetlight
Medications
Available in avocado
Coppertone
Aqua and white
I suffer from the occasional
Emotionally draining dream about turtles
However
The simple idea of omnipresent neutrality
Is difficult
Too much blood
Spills in my dreams
It’s a vascular debacle
Mantras
and
Ak-47s
Are boring
In the park
Getting some vitamin D
The sunlight on my blue jeans
I’m a deadened sapphire
Reading Didion
A psychic residue of fortune is on me
Didion writes,
“I have already lost touch
with a couple of people I used to be”
I can’t handle fate
The aphrodisiac of lying to myself
The battery flavor of anxiety
Shooting the messenger
Having a god that doesn’t ‘get me’

The idea was.
At least in theory,
Dust was a bad thing.

There was a bowl
Of it. At another
Point in time
The conclusion
Was reached
That everything
Was of it.

No season, no
Nothing to measure
To measure against
So no love or hate.
Left us without no
Moorings or so my
Father told me

Vanity tables of it?
Isn’t that what a vanity
Table is for?
What happens to
As its failings accrue?

No mission but to be clean.
Of itself.
But existing (time)
And problems there –
The problem of now
We are back here.

See the whole dust problem’s
No measure.
All’s dust, check.
All’s virtuous, check.
So why not live it up then?
And thus, YOLO etc. etc.

{These fok whirr pretty smart.
Thing is, even in
The dust bowl, the
Idea, a very American
One was that something
Wasn’t dust.
I wasn’t.
The Bowl wasn’t.
The dust wasn’t.

Since Ecclesiastes,
Been trying this one on.
(how’s that working out for you?)
One needn’t be geologically
Or for that matter
Psychologically trained to
Begin unpacking the diffident
And sometimes strained
Relation the nation holds with
All that is vanity.

You see the reason I had
To deliver you to the bank
Where the clangor of my causes
Could not rouse your fiscal ugliness
Was external
As only aridity can produce
Terranean worship of the body as passage.

There was no chill within me
At least not any unticked by time
I had to go in pursuit
Of shaved silicone
And pill queens in linen jumpsuits
I had to devote myself to cashmere chew toys
And create Worklife agendas of self-regard
You are your own pet coward now
Led like a gelding by a pink ribbon
And I am less deceived, but also less adored.

Your amenability to this disarticulation
Is my second victimhood
Beware of verdant land Beware of middling men
Now we slowly dig a trench
And your women ask us why
And you dolt, you have no response for them.

The future will depend on spirits
And the fob off of new Alphas
Who are self-professed business hippies
Soon every person will have been let down
By a guy who buys antiques online

First snow—I release her into it—
I know, released, she won't come back.
This is different from letting what,

already, we count as lost go. It is nothing
like that. Also, it is not like wanting to learn what
losing a thing we love feels like. Oh yes:

I love her.
Released, she seems for a moment as if
some part of me that, almost,

I wouldn't mind
understanding better, is that
not love? She seems a part of me,

and then she seems entirely like what she is:
a white dog,
less white suddenly, against the snow,

who won't come back. I know that; and, knowing it,
I release her. It's as if I release her
because I know.

'I love you,' he wouldn't say: it was against his philosophy; I-love-you
didn't mean what it meant, plus the verray construction of the phrase
caused bad-old-concrete-lawman-vandal-verbal-mildew-upon-the-grape-
harvest-and-war-for-rare-minerals-required-to-manufacture-commu-
nications-devices damage; saying I-love-you damaged love, subject and
object; plus he could prove this in two dense and delphic languages
suitable for philosophy, opera, cursing, and racking the nerves of arti-
ficial intelligence machines that perhaps could love but would be
hard-wired giammai to dare say so. So what moved him to not-say
I-love-you? What wake-up-and-spoil-the-coffee ashtray-licking djinn? I
have to start to agree. The verbness of it impropriety (eyes glob up the
syringe when you're giving blood: semisolid spiralling); perhaps too
active... I-love-you, I sand you, I drill you, I honey and set you for wasps,
crimson you like a stolen toga, add value applying dye, fight owner-
ship, I cite you to justify skilled outrage, put your name as guarantor
on an astronomical mortgage, I admit desertification comes as a relief,
from I to O, O my oasis, O my mirage. Maybe the verb is a tending-to-
wards? A tightrope? A tropism? A station? But that's meeting him on
his own ground; plus I can't disprove entire languages; plus those
three little words aren't meant as saying. An icy drink in stormlight. A
looked-at leaf left to transpire its own way until... And sans I-love-you
the centuried moon rose above dinnermint stone; many men contin-
ued  talking; a woman lifted her sarsenet skirt, peed on green lilies and,
utterly gracious, walked through the archway to join the mixed group
delighting in — word! believe it! — fresh air.

I love these raw moist dawns with
a thousand birds you hear but can't
quite see in the mist.
My old alien body is a foreigner
struggling to get into another country.
The loon call makes me shiver.
Back at the cabin I see a book
and am not quite sure what that is.

Darkness is not a death, does not obliterate,
will not bury you or take your breath away.
Darkness will not erase you the way it erases day with night
because darkness is not the clock but merely the time
falling away from the clock's circular face.
Darkness is not the loss but the thing misplaced,
not the hammer but the nail in its curved emergence
from wood's grasp, not the storm's insurgence
but the limbs broken off from their miraculous
suspension in a storm out far, beyond us.
Darkness is not about hearts, imperfect as they are,
but what leaks through their incorrigible doors, not the stars
but the glissade or glide of their dust.
Darkness no longer shields the hunters' musk
in search of you, or turns you to animal prey,
it is only a measure of weight or days.
Not something without a beginning or an end,
it is not even—especially not—an end.
Nor is it vertigo, nor the whole, but merely a piece.
No, darkness is but a ghost of an idea, the least
remembered, most estranged prayer, and your fear
but a lingering, limbic fear torn from shreds of forgotten years.
Only that much is clear.

I love them all.

I love that a handful, a mouthful, gets you by, a satchelful can land you a job, a
well-chosen clutch of them could get you laid, and that a solitary word can initiate
a stampede, and therefore can be formally outlawed—even by a liberal court
bent on defending a constitution guaranteeing unimpeded utterance. I love that
the Argentine gaucho has over two hundred words for the coloration of horses
and the Sami language of Scandinavia has over a thousand words for reindeer
based on age, sex, appearance—e.g., a busat has big balls or only one big ball.
More than the pristine, I love the filthy ones for their descriptive talent as well as
transgressive nature. I love the dirty ones more than the minced, in that I respect
extravagant expression more than reserved. I admire reserve, especially when
taken to an ascetic nth. I love the particular lexicons of particular occupations.
The substrate of those activities. The nomenclatures within nomenclatures. I am
of the unaccredited school that believes animals did not exist until Adam assigned
them names. My relationship to the word is anything but scientific; it is a matter
of faith on my part, that the word endows material substance, by setting the thing
named apart from all else. Horse, then, unhorses what is not horse.
