Stretch Goals for the machine to learn:
1. Each haiku has a _kireji_, or "cutting word" at the end of one of it's lines. Since no clear english equivilant of this exists, it shall either be represented by a stressed syllable at the end of the line or with ellipses "..."
2. Each haiku can be generated by two words, which are the focus of the poem and are juxtaposed in said haiku. Whether they are opposing, supporting or coexisting(no impact) is randomly determined.
3. Given no user input, the haiku generated will be centered around a randomly generated word or pair of words.
