PYTHON SETUP

We will be using Python 2.7.  This version seems to have the best time working with NLTK and since it has been around for a while, it also has plenty of documentation if we need help.  Instructions are below.

-----DBC computers & MACs with homebrew
-type the following commands:
brew install python
python
--Make sure that the version is 2.7.  This is also how you get to the command line in python.  To exit, you can type exit() or CTRL-D


-----EVERYONE ELSE
Go to https://www.python.org/
Install python vial downloads.  Choose 2.7.


NLTK SETUP - MAC
http://www.nltk.org/install.html

The above link has instrctions.  Long and short of it, on MAC enter the following from your command line....

sudo -H pip install -U nltk --ignore-installed six
sudo -H pip install -U numpy --ignore-installed six

There is currently an issue with the package for six, so some macs have issues.  The --ignore-installed six should fix that.
