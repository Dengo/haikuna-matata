---NLTK usage instructions

---From the commandline, type the following:
$ python
>>> import nltk
>>> import numpy
>>> nltk.download()


---This will download nltk's library.  Make sure to select "all packages".
---if you want to load a particular library, you enter the following from the python interpreter

>>>from nltk.book import *

---This will import all of the data from the "book" module.  There are a ton of modules available with NLTK, so we will have to figure out which ones we want to use.

---The CMU dictionary will contain words and their syllable counts.  We will probably have to add these to a Python dictionary that we create that way we can exclude proper names and any non-English words.  We can use the wordnet module to find only English synonyms for each word that way we only extract what we want.
