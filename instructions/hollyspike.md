# Machine Learning (with focus on natural language) key terms and  other things to help with this project

Corpus- dataset of natural language
corpora- *datasets* 	
annotations- metadata (attributes?) tags that accurately give a machine context to more efficiently and effectively learn
concordances- alphabetical listings of the words in a text collection with references given to the passage in which they occur

POS (part of speech) tagging- an annotation to your dictionary or corpus

syntactic bracketing- the structure that organizes all the words we hear into coherent phrases

Model
Structural descriptions provide theoretically informed attributes derived from empirical observations over the data.

Annotate
An annotation scheme assumes a feature set that encodes specific structural descriptions and properties of the input data.

Train
The algorithm is trained over a corpus annotated with the target feature set.

Test
The algorithm is tested against held-out data.

Evaluate
A standardized evaluation of results is conducted.

Revise
The model and the annotation specification are revisited in order to make the annotation more robust and reliable with use in the algorithm.
